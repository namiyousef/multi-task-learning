Good use of dictionarys to store and evaluate the different heads
Very general




Which tasks to choose?
•	Gradient Similarity for the Auxiliary Losses 
•	https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02224
•	Based on gradient of task loss in comparison to problem loss
•	More which not to take 
•	AUTOSEM
•	https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04153
•	Compares combinations of tasks to find the best
•	Looks tough
